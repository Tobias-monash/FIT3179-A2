                Global GDP Per Capita
            </h2>
            <p>
                The following map depicts the GDP per capita for each country. Several patterns and key points of information can be observed.
                Firstly, it is evident that several regions have a higher GDP per capita than others, such as Europe, Australia, North America and Arabian peninsula standing out as outliers for being much higher than the surrounding regions. 
                The Sub Saharan region of Africa also stands out, however, it is due to having a vastly lower GDP per capita than the rest of the globe. 
                Several countries also stand out on their own for having a much higher GDP per capita than the surrounding countries, such as <span class ="sing"> Singapore</span>, <span class ="japkor">Japan, South Korea</span> and <span class ="venez">Venezuela.</span>
                <br><br>Use the slider beneath the map to filter the countries by population by the millions.

                    <h2>GDP Per Capita - Life Expectancy Correlation</h2>
                    <p>It is evident that there is a positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy. The higher the GDP per capita, the higher the life expectancy. There is also a distinct correlation between region and life expectancy, with <span class = "Africa">Africa</span> having a lower overall life expectancy on average, whereas <span class = "Europe">Europe</span> has a higher live expectancy and GDP per capita on average.

                Continental Birth Rate
            </h2>
            <p>
                The following graph presents a visual representation of the birth rate average for each continent. Each üë∂üèæ emoji represents one birth per 1000 population. It is evident from the graph that Africa is far higher in birth rate on average compared to the other continents, with a 32 birth rate per 1000 population per year. Conversely, Europe has the lowest birth rate on average with a 10 birth rate per 1000 population per year.

                    <p>
                        The graph depicts the infant mortality per 1000 births for the 5 countries with the highest and lowest rates, with the size of the bubble depicting the GDP per capita. It is evident that the 5 countries with the highest infant mortality rate are not only up to 80 times higher than the 5 lowest countries, but also have significantly lower GDP per capita. It can be concluded from the graph that along with a lower GDP per capita, there is also an increase in infant mortality.

                Total Population for Each Language
            </h2>
            <p>
                The following graph depicts the number of countries with a particular official language and their combined total populations. This is used to visualise the potential number of total speakers for a language. The caveat, however, is that this is based off of countries with nominated official languages, as such if a country does not have an official language, such as the case with Australia, then they are grouped together into the 'none' column. It also assumes that the total population of each country speaks the official language of the country. 
                <br><br>With these assumptions in mind, it is clear that <span class = "chin">Chinese</span> and <span class = "hin">Hindi</span> are the most common languages by a large margin. Although other countries, such as <span class = "eng">English</span>, have 30+ countries, they are dwarfed by Hindi and Chinese which have one country respectively.
